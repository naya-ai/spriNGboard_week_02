Notes for fizz buzz: 
Most things were straight foward, and maybe I overlooked some things that can later come to light. I used a void function to call the fizz buzz function instead of going original route with int main().

Notes for fib_recur:
Noticed the sequence started @ 1 and ended @ 44. It told me the seconds it took to compute although.
